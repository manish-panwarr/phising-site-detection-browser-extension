## What is PhishGuard

PhishGuard is a Chrome extension built to help users identify and avoid online threats. When a URL is checked, either manually or by scanning the current browser tab, the extension runs several verification steps against top-tier security APIs. It then calculates a risk score and generates a clear, AI-written summary of the findings.

* Comprehensive risk score based on multiple data sources
* Checks Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, domain age, and SSL status
* Uses Mistral 7B AI model to generate concise summaries from metadata
* Highlights phishing-related indicators like suspicious keywords and TLDs
* Tracks scan history for the most recent 20 sites
* Built-in light and dark themes

## Why Use PhishGuard

Traditional antivirus and browser blocklists are reactive. PhishGuard adds a proactive layer of defense by analyzing URLs not yet flagged elsewhere. Ideal for:

* Users needing a second opinion on suspicious links
* Catching newly registered or obscure phishing domains
* Learning to identify threats by understanding the reasoning

---

## How It Works

The extension performs the following steps during a scan:

1. Accepts a user-provided URL or fetches the current browser tab URL
2. Checks if results are cached from the last 5 minutes
3. Retrieves all API keys securely from chrome storage
4. Runs all API checks in parallel, including:

   * Google Safe Browsing
   * VirusTotal
   * WHOIS domain age
   * SSL certificate
   * URL keyword and TLD analysis
5. Sends the metadata to an AI model (Mistral 7B via OpenRouter)
6. AI generates a summary including impersonation risk and key red flags
7. A final risk score is calculated
8. Results are rendered in the UI and cached for future lookups

---

## API Integrations

PhishGuard integrates with top APIs to ensure robust and accurate checks.

Google Safe Browsing
Provides real-time URL threat checks based on malware, phishing, or unwanted software lists.

VirusTotal
Scans URLs using over 70 antivirus engines and returns malicious or suspicious hit counts.

Whoxy WHOIS
Retrieves domain registration details such as age and registrar.

OpenRouter (Mistral 7B AI)
Translates complex security data into human-readable summaries by simulating a security analyst.
