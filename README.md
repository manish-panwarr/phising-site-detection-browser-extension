# phising-site-detection-browser-extension
A browser extension that can detect whether a website is a phishing or malicious site.

Of course. A detailed README.md file is crucial for any project. Here is a comprehensive README that explains the PhishGuard extension, its purpose, its inner workings, and how a developer can set it up.

PhishGuard - Advanced Phishing & Malware Detection Extension

![alt text](https://via.placeholder.com/150/3498DB/FFFFFF?text=PhishGuard)

PhishGuard is a powerful browser extension that provides a multi-layered defense against phishing, malware, and other malicious websites. It goes beyond simple blocklists by performing a real-time, in-depth analysis of any URL to generate a comprehensive risk score and a human-readable summary.

What is PhishGuard?

PhishGuard is a Chrome extension designed to empower users with the information they need to avoid online threats. When a user provides a URL (either manually or by checking their current tab), the extension initiates a series of checks against leading security and data APIs. The results are aggregated into a single, easy-to-understand risk score (0-100%) and a detailed breakdown of the findings, including a plain-English summary generated by an AI model.

Key Features

✅ Comprehensive Risk Score: Aggregates data from multiple sources into a single percentage score, providing an at-a-glance safety indicator.
✅ Multi-Point Analysis: Checks for threats using Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal's vast antivirus engine database, and WHOIS domain age data.
✅ AI-Powered Summary: Uses the Mistral 7B AI model via OpenRouter to analyze the collected metadata and provide a concise, human-readable verdict, highlighting key red flags.
✅ Detailed Reporting: Offers multiple views of the data, from a high-level summary to a detailed technical report and the full AI analysis.
✅ URL Structure Analysis: Scans the URL itself for suspicious characteristics like the use of an IP address, suspicious TLDs (.xyz, .buzz), or phishing-related keywords (login, secure).
✅ Scan History: Keeps a local history of your last 20 scans for quick reference.
✅ Light & Dark Mode: Includes a theme switcher for user comfort.

Why Use PhishGuard?

Standard antivirus software and browser blocklists are effective but often reactive. PhishGuard provides a proactive layer of security by analyzing sites that may not yet be on a blocklist. It is designed for:

Security-Conscious Users: Anyone who wants a second opinion before clicking a suspicious link in an email or message.

Identifying Novel Threats: New phishing sites are created every minute. By analyzing attributes like domain age and URL structure, PhishGuard can flag a site as suspicious even if it has never been seen before.

Making Informed Decisions: Instead of a simple "block" or "allow," PhishGuard provides the context why a site is risky, helping users learn to spot threats themselves.

How It Works: The Analysis Pipeline

When a user initiates a scan, PhishGuard follows a precise, step-by-step pipeline to ensure a fast and thorough analysis.

URL Input: The user either types a URL into the input field or clicks the "Check Current Tab" button. The input is validated and sanitized.

Cache Check: The extension first checks its local cache. If the same URL was scanned within the last 5 minutes, the cached results are displayed instantly to save time and API calls.

API Key Retrieval: The extension securely retrieves the necessary API keys from chrome.storage.local.

Parallel API Calls: To maximize speed, the extension makes simultaneous (Promise.all) requests to:

Google Safe Browsing: Checks if the URL is on Google's lists of known threats.

VirusTotal: Submits the URL to be checked against over 70 antivirus scanners.

SSL & URL Analysis: Performs local checks on the URL structure and HTTPS status.

Domain Age (WHOIS) Check: After the initial checks complete, it queries the Whoxy API to get domain registration data, a critical indicator for new phishing sites.

AI Analysis Prompt: All the collected metadata (Google status, VirusTotal counts, domain age, SSL status, etc.) is compiled into a detailed prompt for the AI model.

AI Verdict Generation: The prompt is sent to the Mistral 7B model via OpenRouter. The AI analyzes the data and generates a concise summary, including impersonation risk, key red flags, and an overall verdict.

Risk Score Calculation: A weighted algorithm calculates the final risk score based on the severity of the findings from all sources. For example, a positive hit from Google Safe Browsing carries a very high weight.

UI Update: The entire user interface is dynamically updated with the results: the progress circle animates to the final score, colors change based on risk level, and all detailed sections are populated.

Cache & History Update: The new scan result is saved to the local cache and added to the user's scan history.

API Integrations

PhishGuard's power comes from integrating several best-in-class APIs.

Google Safe Browsing API

Website: Google Safe Browsing

What it provides: A definitive check against Google's massive, constantly updated database of unsafe web resources. It identifies threats like malware, social engineering (phishing), and unwanted software.

Why it's important: This is the first line of defense. A positive match from Google is a major red flag and heavily impacts the risk score.

VirusTotal URL Analysis API

Website: VirusTotal API

What it provides: Scans a URL against dozens of different antivirus engines and URL blocklisting services. It returns a count of how many engines flagged the URL as malicious, suspicious, or harmless.

Why it's important: It provides a broad consensus from the security industry. A site flagged by multiple engines is highly likely to be malicious.

Whoxy WHOIS API

Website: Whoxy API

What it provides: Public WHOIS data for a domain, including its creation date, registrar, and owner information (where available).

Why it's important: Domain age is a critical phishing indicator. Legitimate websites usually have domains that are years old. Phishing sites are often created on newly registered domains and are active for only a few days.

OpenRouter (Mistral 7B)

Website: OpenRouter.ai

What it provides: A unified API gateway to access various large language models (LLMs). This project uses it to access Mistral 7B Instruct, a powerful and efficient open-source model.

Why it's important: Raw data can be hard to interpret. The AI model acts as a "security analyst," translating the technical metadata into a clear, understandable summary that explains the risks in plain English.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

A modern web browser that supports extensions (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave).

API keys for the services listed above.

Installation Steps

Clone the Repository:

Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishguard.git
cd phishguard


Load the Extension in Your Browser:

Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page:

Chrome: chrome://extensions

Edge: edge://extensions

Enable "Developer mode" (usually a toggle in the top-right corner).

Click "Load unpacked".

Select the phishguard folder that you cloned. The extension icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar.

API Key Configuration

PhishGuard requires API keys to function. You must set them manually in the extension's storage.

Get Your API Keys:

Google Safe Browsing: Get a key from the Google Cloud Console. You will need to enable the "Safe Browsing API".

VirusTotal: Sign up for a free account and find your API key in your profile settings.

Whoxy: Register for a free or paid plan to get an API key.

OpenRouter: Sign up at OpenRouter.ai and create a new key.

Set the API Keys:

Go to your browser's extensions page (chrome://extensions).

Find the PhishGuard extension and click the link to the service worker or background.js to open the developer console for the extension.

Copy the following code, replace the placeholder values with your actual keys, and paste it into the console. Then press Enter.

Generated javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({
  googleApiKey: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY',
  virustotalApiKey: 'YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY',
  whoxyApiKey: 'YOUR_WHOXY_API_KEY',
  chatGptApiKey: 'YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY' // Note: The key name is 'chatGptApiKey' for legacy reasons
}, () => {
  console.log('PhishGuard API keys have been set successfully!');
});
